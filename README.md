## Next.js Financial Dashboard - Tutorial from the course [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn)

During the course, I built a simplified version of a financial dashboard that has:

- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.

The dashboard also has an accompanying Postgres database.
